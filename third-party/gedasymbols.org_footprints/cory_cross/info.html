<h2>Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li> <a href="tools/footprint_generator.py">footprint_generator.py</a> - Python script to generate footprints automatically from a list of dimensions. Currently only includes SMT caps, little documentation so far. I will update soon, as I'm using this tool right now. Software architecture consists of all generators in this one file, and the user interface (command-line,text,GUI) is subclassed or otherwise uses it. Users can develop their own generator against mine by subclassing before offering it for submission, without worrying about merging any changes I develop in the mean time.
</ul>

<h2>Symbols</h2>

<h2>Footprints</h2>

<p>Note: all my footprints are licensed GPL for distribution, and unlimited for use.</p>

See all my footprints in the <a href="footprints/">footprints/</a> directory.<br>All my footprints should have a meaningful description, have the 0,0 coordinate in the center of the part, and be used on a board before I post them up here. If the part was automatically generated (usually obvious from the filename), I may not have used that exact one, but one of the series has been used on a board and shown to be correct.<br>
Rather than browse my footprints, it's probably best to search for them (since it searches my nice descriptions too).
